# Neural Networks in the Publishing Industry: Boosting Customer Experience and Sales

**### Objective**

This project aims to predict customer churn behavior in the publishing industry by analyzing features such as loyalty, inactive days, order count, price, and order date. Using a provided dataset containing information on books, clients, and orders, we will develop a deep learning model capable of accurately forecasting customer churn. The model will be deployed within a Streamlit-based web application, enabling users to input customer details and receive instant predictions.

**### Project Scope**

We have access to historical data on book orders and customers, featuring details like loyalty, periods of inactivity, order frequency, pricing, order dates, and other relevant attributes from various cities and countries. The goal is to leverage this data to create a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn. This deep learning solution will support businesses in understanding customer behavior, ultimately enhancing retention strategies.

**### Tools and Libraries**

1. Python: The primary programming language for data processing and scripting.

2. Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

3. NumPy: To handle large, multidimensional arrays and perform advanced mathematical operations.

4. Scikit-learn (sklearn): For preprocessing, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

5. Seaborn: A visualization library for creating statistical graphics.

6. Matplotlib.pyplot: To create detailed visualizations and plots.

**## Approach**

**### Data Processing:**

step 1: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency and usability.

step 2: Engineer features from attributes like order dates and loyalty scores to improve model performance.

**### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

step 1: Visualize customer patterns and behaviors using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

step 2: Identify trends, such as the correlation between loyalty and churn or order frequency and churn rates.

**### Model Development:**

step 1: Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow to predict churn behavior.

step 2: Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling.

**### Deployment:**

step 1: Integrate the trained model into a Streamlit web app for easy access and usability.

step 2: Enable users to input customer data and receive churn predictions in real-time.

**### Key Findings**

step 1: Loyal Customers: Higher loyalty scores significantly reduce the likelihood of churn.

step 2: Order Frequency: Customers with fewer orders are more likely to churn.

step 3: Temporal Patterns: Churn behavior is evenly distributed across different years.
